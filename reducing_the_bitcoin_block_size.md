# Overview

The bitcoin whitepaper describes a p-2-p cash system that does not require a financial intermediary. This system relies on distrubuted computers, that run a software implementation that serves as a bitcoin node, to validate transactions according to the agreed upon consensus rules.

## Interpretation

The whole value of bitcoin is based upon it's decentralized network. Decentralization, therefore, can be measured by the number of full nodes veryfing transactions.

## Proposal

Reducing the block size by 85% would help with the initial download/sync. The current block size is 2 megabytes.

When you set up your full node for the first time, you need to download the entire bitcoin blockchain, which is hundreds of gigabytes.

Individuals and corporations are now less inclined to run a full node, and rely on blockchain infrastructure from a third-party provider.

## System Specifications

**This varies according to your hardware:**

- 8 GB RAM
- 8 Core(s), 16 Logical Processor(s)
- 1 TB SSD

**Internet speed:**

- 264.6 mbps download
- 211.9 mbps upload
- 7 ms latency

Assuming optimal conditions and no interuptions, the initial sync would take roughly seven hours.

*Adjusting for 300 kilobyte block size:*

The initial sync would take roughly one hour.
