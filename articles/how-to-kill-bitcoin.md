# Overview

This article serves as a thought expiriment. I like to ponder constantly on how bitcoin could be destroyed *(I'm exaggerating for dramatic effect because bitcoin can be slowed down, but not destroyed.)*.

## Thought Experiment

You are a nation-state with unlimited resources. You have been tasked to destroy bitcoin at all costs. No proposal will be too ludicrous or expensive. This is how I would do it.

### Destroying mining infrastructure

1. First, I would seize all mining farms within my jurisdiction. Then, I would make substantial donations to other nations so that they can do the same within their jurisdiction.

2. Secondly, I would ban bitcoin mining domestically and ask that my fellow nations do the same. I would make substantial donations that were needed for other nations to oblige.

3. I would go behind the companies making mining equipment, scaring off outside money and investors.

4. I would provide substantial donations to key bitcoin developers and figures to promote the idea of the *"nuclear option"*. In bitcoin, the nuclear option refers to changing SHA-256 for a different algorithm, making current ASICs obsolete.

5. I would pour in millions of dollars to create the new ASIC miners, and I would purposely build the new miners with a zero-day exploit. When the new miners are distributed among the world (across the different nations that did not fold to my substantial donations) I would use the exploit I created to wreck the miners, thus causing major network disruptions and tainting the reputation of the bitcoin network security.

### Legal and regulatory warfare on individuals or corporations interested in bitcoin

6. This would require global coordination of laws and regulations, however, I am counting on my substantial donations will make this possible. Some of those laws would be as follows:

7. Ban bitcoin exchanges, making it extremely difficult to convert bitcoin into fiat.

8. Outlaw financial institutions from accepting bitcoin as payment.

9. Impose severe penalties for holding or transacting in bitcoin.

10. Restrict access to ISPs or domains that host bitcoin-related services.

### Target nodes, developers and the internet services

11. Strict censorship of the internet in key regions to block access to the bitcoin network. To make this work, I would require large ISPs to oblige to assist with deep packet inspection to block bitcoin traffic.

12. Identify and shut down bitcoin nodes (assuming their IP address is not obfuscated) making it harder to propagate transactions across the network.

13. Intimidate and/or arrest developers that contribute and maintain the bitcoin software. I would first target bitcoin core developers since bitcoin core is the most widely spread implementation of bitcoin. I would then move on to the developers of other less-used implementations.

### Flood the network with spam via Sybil or DDOS attacks

14. Deploy massive amounts of computational resources to flood the network with spam transactions.

15. Create thousands of fake nodes making the network extremely slow. This network congestion would drive users away.

### Undermine public trust

16. Create PR campaigns that spread mass disinformation about bitcoin to create doubt and fear. **(ironically, this method is currently the most popular approach at the moment, unintentionally)**

17. Spread disinformation about bitcoin's energy consumption, without acknowledging most of the energy comes from renewable, self-sustainable sources.

18. Spread disinformation about fraud and nefarious use cases, even though bitcoin is more traceable than fiat.

19. Manipulate legacy media to erode public perception, portraying bitcoin as unsafe or useless compared to fiat or other nation-backed alternatives.

## Caveats

1. Decentralization is bitcoin's biggest defence mechanism. Coordination across multiple nations is empirical.

2. Individuals could still run nodes privately by using mesh networks, satellite links or VPNs.

3. Transaction fees need to be considered when introducing spam attacks.

4. Logistically speaking, this would be the most expensive war known in human history. We made the assumption this nation-state has unlimited resources, but in the real world, there is no such thing.

5. The way the protocol was designed, it forces all participants to opt for a cooperative strategy, since it's the most cost-effective.
