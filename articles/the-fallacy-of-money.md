# The Fallacy of Money

"If everyone believes it's money, it will become accepted as money."

## Overview

I would like to discuss why believing something is money, doesn't make it money. The belief that money is a mass belief system is wrong and it disregards its inherit properties. I use the word disregard lightly because I believe it disrespects money as a technology.

## Pre-cursor

This article assumes you understand the inherit properties of money.

## Thought Experiment

I want you to imagine a society where everyone coexists and it has a vibrant economy. In this theoretical society, apples are used as money.

## Arguments

1. **Betrayed by nature:** the inherit properties of the apple lack durability. In a way, it also lacks divisibility. It will take less than a month for the apples to rot.

2. **Lack of scarcity:** apples are relatively simple to acquire, grow and harvest. In this theoretical society, a savvy entrepreneur may realize it is a lot less work-intensive to produce new apples into the market, rather than acquiring them via means of exchange or labour.

3. **Technology doesn't cheat:** if we ought to disregard the properties of money as a technology, what is stopping the members of this theoretical society of creating the first apple airplane? After all, if you believe something to be true, it *must* make it real? I wish safe travels to the members aboard the apple airplane.

## Fiat

We don't use fiat because we collectively believe it's money. During the time fiat was popularized, it served as a great technology that could be easily transferred, divided and somewhat scarce *(under the gold standard, which is NOT to be confused with the petro-dollar)*.

The issue with fiat, is that somewhere along the lines it started failing as a technology that could protect our purchasing power, due to the lack of scarcity.

## Spoiler

In my next article, I will discuss the shortcomings of bitcoin. Ironically, none if its shortcomings are related to its inherited properties of money. In that matter, bitcoin is the winner that takes all.
